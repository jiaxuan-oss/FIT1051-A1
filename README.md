Assessment #1
Submission deadline:  7th November 2022 5pm MYT via Moodle

Instructions
Below are the coding tasks that you need to complete for assessment 1. Your work and your submission should be independent. Please download the IntelliJ project folder below and unzip it. This will provide you with a partial code in which to program your answers.  Please complete each task in the appropriate section of the partial code, and submit upon completion.

Task 4 is worth 12 marks

Task 5 is worth 5 marks

Academic Integrity
Please be reminded of the academic integrity mentioned in Week 01. You should code alone and ask the unit staff for help if needed. Do not post your code in public forums or send your code to anyone.

Task 1 (W2 - 11 marks)
Please implement your code in the method labelled task1() in the Assessment1 class of the downloaded project. 


Your code should print the numbers 5,8,4 and 2 to the screen, each in its own separate output line. Then, the code should add all of the numbers and display their sum to the screen, on yet another output line. 

The output of your code should look like this: 

5

8

4

2

19

Please do this in 3 ways:

Without using variables at all.

Using 4 independent variables (one for each number) and another variable for the sum.

Reusing the same variable for the numbers and an additional variable for the sum.

Task 2 (W2 - 17 marks)
Please implement your code in the method labelled task2() in the Assessment1 class of the downloaded project. 


Choose and declare the most appropriate variable type for each of the following values, including the assignment of an initial value (double, char, int, float, etc...).  Then write code to display the value of each variable together with a suitable description. 

For example, if the description says, "Your height" you will define : 

float height = 1.85f; 
and you will print "Your height: 1.85m" to the screen in a separate line. 

Please do this for the following: 

Your jogging speed in miles per hour (mph). 

The name of a FIT1051 lecturer allocated to a workshop. 

The capacity of passengers in a train wagon. 

The length of a desk in millimetres. 

The state of a light switch. 

The number of books on a library shelf. 

The amount of COVID vaccinations a person can have so far. 

The current temperature of the day. 

The number of Aces in a deck of cards. 

The memory size of a computer chip. 

The state of a traffic light, which can be either “RED”, “YELLOW”, or “GREEN”. 

(Hint: data types need to be declared and initialised before use)


Task 3 (W2 - 15 marks)
Please implement your code in the method labelled task3() in the Assessment1 class of the downloaded project. 


Declare variables with data type float, int, String, double and boolean and give all of them an initial sensible value of the appropriate type. Now try to assign the value of each to the other variables (assigning the value of the int variable to the float variable, int variable to the boolean variable, etc...) . For each assignment statement, answer the following questions:

Which conversions does Java perform automatically? 

Which conversions will Java perform with a cast? What are the side effects of these cast(s)?

Hint: you will have to comment out assignment statements that cause a compilation error

Task 4 (W2 - 12 marks)
Please implement your code in the method labelled task4() in the Assessment1 class of the downloaded project. 


Draw a smiley face using the alias symbol (@) as pictured in the figure below. The height of the figure should be 15 lines. Output your smiley face using only one line of System.out.println().

Hint: You can use String concatenation & compound assignment operators.

NOTE: You are not allowed to use any selection control structures or repetition control structures as we have not covered the material yet.


Task 5 (W2 - 5 marks)
Please implement your code in the method labelled task5() in the Assessment1 class of the downloaded project. 


Declare a String variable called s that is initialised as null and use that variable to invoke/call a method  from the available methods of the String Class library (see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html, Method Summary). Then output your result in the IntelliJ terminal. An error will occur when you compile your code. Answer the questions below as comments in your code.

What is the error? 

Step by step how and why the error happens. 


Code Readability (5 marks)
Overall code submission must be well organised and very easy to follow including, but not limited to, code indentation, code consistency, effective use of whitespace etc. 

Code Development & Documentation (5 marks)
Overall code submission should demonstrate correct syntax usage and meaningful naming conventions. Code documentations/inline comments should be thorough and detailed.
